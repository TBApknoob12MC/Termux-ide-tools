# Termux-improver
Shell scripts automating installation(and much more) of (nvchad?) things so I don't break my bone with ampersand 

It is kind of like termux desktop, but I feel that gui ide on termux is kinda bloat and nonproductive.

That's why I made this script (maybe cringe)

Neovim with NVchad included :D

PREREQUISITES:
Termux ( gplay is ded so get from github or f-droid )
internet ( maybe... 500 mb of data)
some storage (minimum 2 gigs if u wanna install more application )
