# Termux-improver
Shell scripts automating installation(and much more) of (nvchad?) things so I don't break my bone with ampersand 

It is kind of like termux desktop, but I feel that gui ide on termux is kinda bloat and nonproductive.

That's why I made this script (maybe cringe)

Neovim with NVchad included :D

PREREQUISITES:
Termux (gplay is ded so get from github or f-droid - fresh install recommended)

internet (maybe... 500 mb of data)


some storage (minimum 2 gigs if u wanna install more application)

INSTALLATION:
```sh
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TBApknoob12MC/Termux-improver/main/install.sh | bash
```

after that when oh my zsh asks about making zsh default shell,type 'y' and you are in zsh - type 'exit' to exit from the zsh or else the bash script won't continue

after reopening type nvim 

wait some time and then when you see nvim opening and see like 'tree-sitter : installed' at the bottom of termux(from my memory),type :q multiple(3) times until you get out of nvim

u got a good looking ide/experiment sandbox
