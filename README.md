# Termux-improver
Shell scripts automating installation(and much more) of (nvchad?) things so I don't break my bone with ampersand 

It is kind of like termux desktop, but I feel that gui ide on termux is kinda bloat and nonproductive.

That's why I made this script (maybe cringe)

Neovim with NVchad included :D

PREREQUISITES:
Termux (gplay is ded so get from github or f-droid - fresh install recommended)

internet (maybe... 500 mb of data)


some storage (minimum 2 gigs if u wanna install more application)

INSTALLATION:
```sh
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TBApknoob12MC/Termux-improver/main/install.sh | bash
```

wait some time and then when you see nvim opening and see like 'tree-sitter : installed' at the bottom of termux(from my memory),type :q multiple times until you get out of nvim

after that when oh my zsh asks about making zsh default shell,type 'y' and you are in zsh - type 'exit' to exit from the zsh or else the bash script won't continue

after that when you see '~$', if you are able to type, then type exit and reopen termux.

u got a good looking ide/experiment sandbox
